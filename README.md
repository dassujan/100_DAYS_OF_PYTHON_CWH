Python is a dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming approaches. It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989. Some key features of Python include:

- Simplicity and ease of understanding.
- Interpretation and platform independence, making debugging easier.
- Open-source nature, allowing for community contributions and collaboration.
- Extensive library support, with popular libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow, Selenium, and OpenCV.
- Ability to integrate with other programming languages.

## What is Python used for?

Python finds applications in various domains, including:

- **Data Visualization**: Creating plots and graphical representations.
- **Data Analytics**: Analyzing and understanding raw data for insights and trends.
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Simulating human behavior and learning from past data without hard coding.
- **Web Application Development**: Building web applications.
- **Database Handling**: Managing databases.
- **Business and Accounting**: Performing complex mathematical operations, quantitative and qualitative analysis.
