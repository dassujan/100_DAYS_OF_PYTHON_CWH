# Class Methods in Python

In Python, classes are used to define objects that have certain properties and methods. A method is a function that is associated with a class, and it is used to define the behavior of the objects that are created from the class.

Here are some commonly used class methods in Python:

## __init__ method

The `__init__` method is a special method that is automatically invoked when you create a new instance of a class. This method is responsible for setting up the objectâ€™s initial state, and it is where you would typically define any instance variables that you need. This method is also called the "constructor".

## __str__ and __repr__ methods

The `__str__` and `__repr__` methods are both used to convert an object to a string representation. The `__str__` method is used when you want to print out an object, while the `__repr__` method is used when you want to get a string representation of an object that can be used to recreate the object.

## __call__ and __len__ methods

The `__call__` method is used to make an object callable, meaning that you can pass it as a parameter to a function and it will be executed when the function is called. This is an incredibly powerful tool that allows you to create objects that behave like functions.

The `__len__` method is used to get the length of an object. This is useful when you want to be able to find the size of a data structure, such as a list or dictionary.
