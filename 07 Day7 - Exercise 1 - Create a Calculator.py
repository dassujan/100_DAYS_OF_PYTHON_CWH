# Create a calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations on two numbers. Your program should format the output in a readable manner!

n = 15
m = 7
ans1 = n+m
print("Addition of",n,"and",m,"is", ans1)
ans2 = n-m
print("Subtraction of",n,"and",m,"is", ans2)
ans3 = n*m
print("Multiplication of",n,"and",m,"is", ans3)
ans4 = n/m
print("Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans4)
ans5 = n%m
print("Modulus of",n,"and",m,"is", ans5)
ans6 = n//m
print("Floor Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans6)
