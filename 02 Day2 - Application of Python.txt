Day 2 - My Python Success Story

What is Python Programming?
Python is an object-oriented, interpreted, and high-level programming language with active semantics. The high-level inbuilt data constructions, united with dynamic binding and dynamic typing, make it attractive for Rapid Application Development. It also makes it alluring for the usage as a glue language or scripting to link prevailing components together.
Python language has an easy-to-learn and simple syntax that emphasizes readability. In this way, it diminishes the rate of program maintenance. Python frameworks support packages and modules, which encourages code reuse and program modularity.
Guido van Rossum started working on Python in the 1980s, as a descendant of the ABC programming language and released it in 1991.
The extensive standard library and the Python interpreter are obtainable in binary or source form without the charge for all key platforms and can be distributed freely. Python renders numerous useful features which make it valuable and popular from the rest of the programming languages.
